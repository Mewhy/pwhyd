# Progress Reports!
## Important updates on development!

## May 29th, 2018 // 2:42AM PST
Hello, World! The project has been up for a few days now. I thought it might be fitting to make a small page for blog entries of the game's development!
Currently, PWHYD is still very young. While I have been working nonstop, I've only scratched the surface of what the engine has to offer. I've done
a whole lot of rerouting, poking, and messing around with the code, and am starting to get the hang of things. Nevertheless, there are still things I am
totally clueless on. While I have been messing around with programming for as long as I can remember, Assembly and scripting for Pokemon games is still
relatively new to me. I've picked up on a lot of how the game seems to work, but still, being a second generation Pokemon game, the game is still a mess
of code and scripts jumbled together in the form of .ASM files. 

Making a ROM hack is a daunting project. As of now, I have nearly completed all the scripting in the starter town, and am excited to move on to forming the 
rest of the story in the PWHYD alternate universe! While I have the space in this entry, I would also like to mention that **development during Summer 2018 will 
be nearly halted.** This is due to me volunteering at a Summer camp, which will take up most of my time. With the spare time I do have, I will try to open up Visual Studio 
and get a few things done, but don't expect much. This may be the first and last update until sometime after August 2018. Even though this is a setback, I definitely will 
try to get commits in while I have the time.

Thanks for reading!
